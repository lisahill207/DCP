# Degree Completion Plan

This project is a form to create a degree completion plan (DCP). The DCP is a tool used in academic advising to aid students in planning their academic career and path to graduation.

I have been an academic advisor at Towson University since 2019. During this time, coworkers have voiced their desire for a university wide form to standardize the DCP process. Currently, all departments create their own from, many using word or excel documents. I worked with coworkers to create multiple iterations of this form, discussing priorities and desires.

The final product was built using React and mimics the Towson University website. When submitted, it creates a PDF which can be uploaded to department databases and advising software.
